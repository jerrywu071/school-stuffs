\chapter{Software Architecture}

\section{Evolution of programming abstractions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item First computers used punchcards and were hardwired
    \item First software was written in assembly
    \item In the 1960s, high level programming languages like Fortran, Cobol, Pascal, C, etc. were introduced to make code more readable and easier to use/understand
    \item ADTs and OOP in the mid 1970s
    \item Design patterns first introduced in 1990s, allows object reuse
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Why software architecture?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item As software size and complexity increases, the design problem goes beyond data structures and algorithms
    \item Designing and specifying the overall system structure emerges as a new kind of problem
    \item Recall reference architecture and product line architecture
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software architecture issues}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Organization and global control structure
    \item Protocols of communication, synchronization, and data access
    \item Assignment of functionality to design elements
    \item Physical distribution of product
    \item Selection among design alternatives
\end{itemize}

\subsection{State of practice}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Currently, there is no well defined terminology or notation to characterize architectural structures and systems
    \item Good software engineers will make common use of architectural principles when designing complex software systems
    \item These are simply principles or idiomatic patterns that have emerged over time
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Descriptions of software architectures}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Example 1}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Camelot is based on the \textbf{client server model} and uses remote procedure calls both locally and remotely to provide communication among appplications and servers
        \item We have chosen a distributed \textbf{object oriented} approach to managing information
    \end{itemize} 

    \item \textbf{Example 2}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Abstraction layering} (layered architecture) and system decomposition provide the appearance of system uniformity to clients, yet allow HeliX to accomidate a diversity of autonomous devices (self managing systems like server management, not self driving cars)
        \item The architecture encourages a \textbf{client server model} for structuring of applications
    \end{itemize} 

    \item \textbf{Example 3}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The easiest way to make a canonical \textbf{sequential} compiler into a \textbf{concurrent} compiler is to \textbf{pipeline} the execution of the compilar phases over a number of processors
        \item A more effective way is to \textbf{split the source code into many segments which are concurrently processed through the various phases of compilation} (by multiple compiler processes) before a final \textbf{merging} pass recombines the object code into a single program
    \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Some standard software architectures}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ISO/OSI reference model} is a layered network architecture
    \item \textbf{X Window System} is a distributed windowed user interface architecture based on event triggering and callbacks. Linux can run without a GUI, but it can have a windowed GUI thanks to this.
    \item \textbf{NIST/ECMA reference model} is a generic software engineering environment architecture based on layered communication substrates
\end{itemize}

\section{Intuition about architecture}

We need to look at several architectural disciplines to develop an intuition about software architecture. Specifically:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hardware architecture
    \item Network architecture
    \item Building architecture
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware architecture}

\begin{itemize}
    \item RISC machines emphasize the instruction set as an important feature
    \item Pipelined and multiprocessor machines emphasize the configuration of architectural pieces of the hardware
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Differences between hardware and software architecture}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Differences}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Relatively small (compared to software) number of design elements
        \item Scale is achieved by replication of design elements
    \end{itemize} 

    \item \textbf{Similarities}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We often configure software architectures in an analogous way to hardware. E.g. we create multi process software by using pipelining and multithreading
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software vs network architecture}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Networked architectures are achieved by abstracting the design elements of a network into nodes and connections
    \item Topology is the most emphasized aspect
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Star topology
        \item Ring Topology
        \item Manhattan street networks
    \end{itemize}

    \item Unlike software architectures, network architectures only have a few topologies of interest
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software vs building architeture}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multiple views}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Skeleton frames, detailed views of electric wiring, etc.
        \item SW: class UML, use cases, etc
    \end{itemize} 

    \item \textbf{Architectural styles}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Classical, roman, etc.
        \item SW: pipelines, layers, etc.
    \end{itemize} 

    \item \textbf{Materials}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Do not build a skyscraper using wooden posts and beams
        \item SW: algorithms (e.g. which sorting algorithm to use)
    \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What are architectural styles}

\begin{itemize}
    \item An architectural style defines a family of systems in terms of a pattern of structural organization. It determines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The vocabulary of components and connectors that can beused in instances of that style
        \item A set of constraints on how said components can be combined together into a system
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Why bother with architectural styles?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Makes for an easy way to \textbf{communicate} among stakeholders
    \item \textbf{Documentation} of early design decisions
    \item Allow for the \textbf{reuse and transfer} of qualities to similar systems
\end{itemize}

\section{Types of architectural styles}
\subsection{Disclaimer}
There is no architectural style that is a silver bullet. Every style has their advantages and disadvantages.
\subsection{Pipe and filter}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Suitable for applications that require a defined \textbf{series of independent computations} to be performed on \textbf{ordered data}. 
    \item A component reads streams of data on its inputs and produces streams of data on its outputs
    \item \textbf{VERY COMMON FOR COMPILERS}
    \item \textbf{Components}: called \textbf{filters}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item apply local transformations to their input streams
        \item they often do their computing incrementally so that output begins before all input is consumed
    \end{itemize} 

    \item \textbf{Connectors}: called pipes
    \begin{itemize}
        \item serve as conduits for the streams
        \item transmitting outputs of one filter to the inputs of another
    \end{itemize} 

    \item \textbf{Invariants of pipes and filters}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Filters do not share states with other filters
        \item Filters do not know the identity of their upstream or downstream filters
        \item The correctness of output of a pipe and filter network should not depend on the order in which their filters perform their incremental processing
    \end{itemize} 

    \item \textbf{Specializations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Pipelines: Restricts topologies to \textbf{linear sequences} of filters
        \item Batch sequential: A degenerate case of pipeline architecture where \textbf{each filter processes all of its input data before producing any output}
    \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Examples of pipe and filter}

\begin{itemize}
    \item UNIX shell scripts: Provides a notation for connecting UNIX processes via pipes. E.g. \texttt{cat file | grep Eroll | wc -l}
    \item Traditional compilers: Compilation phases are pipelined though the phases are not always incremental. The phases in the pipeline inclide:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item lexical analysis
        \item parsing
        \item semantic analysis
        \item code generation
    \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Advantages and disadvantages of P\&F}

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Advantages}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Easy to understand} the overall input/output behavior of a system; composition of the behaviors of the individual filters
        \item They \textbf{support reuse} since any two filters can be hooked together; common data formats between them
        \item Systems can be \textbf{easily maintained and enhanced}; new filters can be added and old filters can be replaced
        \item They permit certain kinds of \textbf{specialized analysis} like throughput and deadlock analysis
        \item They naturally support \textbf{concurrent execution}
    \end{itemize} 

    \item \textbf{Disadvantages}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Not good for handling \textbf{interactive systems} due to their transformational character
        \item Excessive parsing and unparsing leads to \textbf{loss of performance} and \textbf{increased complexity}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Repository style}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Suitable for applications in which the central issue is \textbf{establishing, augmenting, and maintaining} a complex central body of information
    \item Typically the information must be manipulated in a variety of ways. \textbf{Persistent data/storage is required}
    \item In a nutshell, pretty much anything which has a \textbf{database, or is a management system}
    
    \item \textbf{Components}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A central data structure representing the current state of the system
        \item A collection of independent components that operate on the central data structure
    \end{itemize} 

    \item \textbf{Connectors}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Typically procedure calls or direct memory accesses
    \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
