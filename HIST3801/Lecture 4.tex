\section{Moral panic}

\subsection{What is moral panic?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A theory created by Stanley Cohen
    \item Moral panic almost always involves a "think of the children" mentality
    \item Moral panic reveals division within society
    \item Moral panic thrives on exaggeration of a real issue
    \item Moral panic is a quick matter which fizzles out, or something that carries long term repercussions
\end{itemize}

\section{Mods and rockers}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Working class subcultures of youth during the 1960s
    \item These two groups rallied around transportation and being able to go places
    \item A series of brawls between the groups led the British media labelling them as dangerous roving gangs of disaffected youths. These were not violent gunfights or knife fights, but just fist fights
    \item The media exaggerated the issues, leading to a moral panic
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Deviancy amplification}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Form of exaggeration used in creating moral panics. An irrational amplification of threat for unusual behaviors.
\end{itemize}

\section{Revisiting arcades}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Arcades were known for gambling, drinking and smoking
    \item This leads to a large medium for moral panics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Death race}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Death race is a 1975 movie about a dystopian future where managing resources once per year, the government mandates a purge where people race in cars and crashing into people to kill them (especially for the elderly because they would be known as a resource drain)
    \item Was eventually made into a video game in 1976
    \item Was worried about for a very short time. People were concerned that the game was to train kids to enjoy the action of vehicular homocide
    \item Because games with violent content were unregulated for a while, the government wanted to make companies regulate them, thus the ESRB rating system was born
\end{itemize}
