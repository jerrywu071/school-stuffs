\section*{XML advantages}


\begin{itemize}
    \item XML is used exclusively for the view. We can separate concerns between function and form by using MVC.
    \item The ID attribute: \texttt{android:id="@+id/decbutton"} signifies that we are pulling a value, in this case, a button from the \texttt{R} (resources) class. 
    \item \texttt{R.java} is automatically generated based on what is in the XML view. This allows us to change a single value in the XML to change \textbf{all} occurences of that value in code.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Layout parameters}
An app activity can have multiple layouts.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Layouts take on the form of \texttt{layout\_foo}
  \item \texttt{LinearLayout}: every element is stacked sequentially on the screen depending on the orientation of the screen.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{What is a layout?}
Simply put, a layout is what defines the UI elements in a given activity (screen). It is the \textbf{parent view} to all other elements within it. A \texttt{Layout} is a \texttt{ViewGroup}, and a \texttt{ViewGroup} is a \texttt{View}

\subsection*{Dynamic layout}
In a dynamic layout, the elements on the screen are not pre determined. In other words, \texttt{AdapterView} is used to populate the layout with views \textbf{at runtime} like \texttt{ListView}, \texttt{GridView}, etc. These are very common views for organizing data in many applications, since they display items in either a list or a grid respectively.
