\begin{abstract}
    This document will outline the ways in which Google's Inactive Account Manager adheres to the 10 universal principles of the attention economy as outlined by Gus et al. of the United Nations. The principles are:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[1.] Individual sovereignty
        \item[2.] Harmlessness
        \item[3.] Privacy and data protection
        \item[4.] Transparency
        \item[5.] Accountability
        \item[6.] Fairness and inclusivity
        \item[7.] Freedom from exploitation
        \item[8.] Harmony with nature
        \item[9.] Attention literacy
        \item[10.] Adaptive systems
    \end{itemize}

    The document will give each principle a degree of adherence rating based on a 3 star system (0 to 3 stars).

\section{Individual Sovereignty}
    \subsection{Attention sovereignty}
        \begin{quote}
            \textit{"Individuals should retain self-determination, ownership, access and control of self-
            generated attention economy data and content captured based on human interaction
            behavior, with the ability to revoke access for any reason."}
        \end{quote}
        
        This sub principle applies to the inactive account manager, as the owner of the account can control who gets access to their data/what happens with it if they die or are inactive for an extended period of time.

    \subsection{Right to reward}
    \begin{quote}
        \textit{"Individuals should have the reasonable capability to understand, earn or allocate a
        significant portion of the rewards generated from the value of their attention and
        data."}
    \end{quote}

    Because the inactive account manager allows the user to keep certain parts of their data hidden even from trusted users, the allocation of a portion of rewards part of this principle would apply.
