\chapter{Introduction}

\subsection*{Value based evaluation of technology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Technology is not neutral, good or bad
    \item Can we assign a degree of badness to things? In this case, technology as a concept
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Thanatechnology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item "Thanatos" is Greek for death
    \item Thanatosensitivity is a research method which takes into account and actively seeks to integrate the facts of mortality, dying, and death into a user centered design
    \item This is often applied in HCI and AI research; such phenomena are known as thanatechnologies. These technologies often seek to memorialize and preserve certain finite things that have great meaning, such as a human life.
    \item A good example of this is creating a chatbot of a close friend or a loved one based on their mannerisms to preserve their memory, though this is debated heavily in terms of whether it is morally right. Would it be too creepy? Would it be wrong if the dead person doesn't give consent for such a creation? (Eugenia Kuyda)
    \item 
\end{itemize}
