\title{How to make an explainer video}

\date{}

\maketitle

\section*{Introduction}
This short guide will cover how to make an explainer video about a technological concept (or anything for that matter)

\section*{Prerequesites}
The following basic skills and softwares will be used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A computer with a microphone and any video editor installed (I used Davinci Resolve)
    \item Basic knowledge on video editing
\end{itemize}

\section*{Instructions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[0.] Pre record voice recordings. This can be reading off a script or just rambling about the topic in question
    \item[1.] Prepare a folder with all voice recordings, videos, and images/graphics along with other assets for ease of organization
    \item[2.] Import your assets into video editor
    \item[3.] Drag and drop image and video assets onto the project timeline
    \item[4.] Align images relating to the topics that are being talked about in the voice recording with the voice recordings (i.e. display an image of an apple when talking about apples)
    \item[5.] Add transitions between image/video assets like fade in, cuts, etc. to make the video more dynamic
\end{itemize}

\section*{Troubleshooting}
I personally did not rehearse saying the contents of my script, so as a result I had to re record myself a number of times. As a result of this, I wasted a lot of time that could have been spent doing other stuff.\\ \\To avoid this mistake, just practice reading your script before the first take of the recording (ESPECIALLY if you hate the sound of your own voice like I do.)
